# Advancing UAV-Based Inspection System: The USSA-Net Segmentation Approach to Crack Quantification
This repository contains the python implementation for the paper "Advancing UAV-Based Inspection System: The USSA-Net Segmentation Approach to Crack Quantification".

## Dataset

**Note**: The `data/` file does not have to be within your project, you can put it somewhere you want. Please remembet to fill the correct data path in `config/tcrnn.yaml`.

## Get Started
### Dependencies
We strongly recommend that you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for this project, it can save you much timeüòÅ! Note that the related configurations has already been within `.devcontainer`. The detail information can be found in this [Tutorial_for_Vscode&Dokcer](https://github.com/Devin-Pi/Tutorial_for_VScode_Docker).

### Configurations
The realted configurations are all saved in `config/`.
